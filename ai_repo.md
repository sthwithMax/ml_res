## AI Model collection

## biogpt
* **HuggingFace Link:**  https://huggingface.co/microsoft/biogpt
* **Description:** Pre-trained language models have attracted increasing attention in the biomedical domain, inspired by their great success in the general natural language domain.
* **Tags:** model, pytorch, biomedical

## ClinicalBERT
* **HuggingFace Link:**  https://huggingface.co/medicalai/ClinicalBERT
* **Description:** This model card describes the ClinicalBERT model, which was trained on a large multicenter dataset with a large corpus of 1.2B words of diverse diseases we constructed. We then utilized a large-scale corpus of EHRs from over 3 million patient records to fine tune the base language model.
* **Tags:** model, pytorch, medical
